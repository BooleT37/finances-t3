## General app architecture

### Next.js

The app uses Next.js, and pages router. The app is NOT using App Router.

### Data fetching with React Query

We use React Query to fetch and mutate data. Then we transform the data to domain objects, like Expense.ts. We DO NOT mutate/fetch data from domain objects. If we do, somewhere, it's an artifact of migration from Mobx, and should be removed.
